In Objective-C, a rare but impactful error arises from the misuse of `performSelector:withObject:afterDelay:` alongside ARC (Automatic Reference Counting). If the object scheduled for execution is deallocated before the delay elapses, calling the selector on a deallocated object will lead to a crash.  This often happens when dealing with asynchronous tasks and improper handling of object lifecycles.
